# Welcome to Choong Hee (Frank) Kim's Page

Hi all! I am a 2nd year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Mechanical Engineering in Cornell University. My research interest broadly lies in robotics, machine learning, computer vision for autonomous agents. Currently, I am especially interested in figuring out the interaction among groups of people (i.e. Team Sports!). Starting from control and optimization field, my interest gradually moved to perception and planning.
